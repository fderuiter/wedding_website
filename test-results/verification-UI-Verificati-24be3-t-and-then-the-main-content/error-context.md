          - paragraph [ref=e54]: It all began with a swipe right on a cool evening in 2024. Abbi was drawn to Fred's adventurous spirit, while Fred was captivated by Abbi's warm smile and shared love for hotdogs. Our first date involved Fred plugging the laser loon and ended with hours of conversation that felt like minutes.
          - paragraph [ref=e55]: Since then, we've built a life filled with laughter, shared dreams, and countless adventures. From exploring parks to cozy nights in binge-watching our favorite shows, we've collected countless miles on the odometer, concert stubs, a few wolves tickets, and a growing library of inside jokes. We've supported each other through thick and thin, celebrating milestones like Abbi's graduation as a Nurse Practitioner, and learned that home isn't just a place, but a feeling we find in each other.
          - paragraph [ref=e56]: As we all were saying goodbye to 2024 and bringing in 2025, Fred recreated our very first date together in downtown Minneapolis. While the ball had just dropped, Fred asked Abbi to be his forever adventure partner, starting the new year right. Through happy tears, she said yes! Now, we're eagerly counting down the days until we say "I do" surrounded by the people we love most. We are so excited to celebrate our love and begin our next chapter with you at our Plummer House wedding.
