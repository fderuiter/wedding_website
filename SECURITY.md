# Security Policy (Such As It Is)

## Supported Versions

Look, this is a wedding website, not Fort Knox. We patch the live version when we notice something's broken or, you know, *really* insecure. We're not exactly rolling out LTS branches here.

| Version          | Supported          | Notes                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Latest Deployed  | :white_check_mark: | The one that's actually running. Hopefully. |
| Previous Versions| :x:                | They're history. Like that questionable Jell-O mold Aunt Carol brought. |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a gaping security hole? First off, thanks for not plastering it all over Twitter or creating a dramatic GitHub issue â€“ my inbox is scary enough already. We genuinely appreciate you trying to tell us quietly.

**How to Report (The Right Way):**

* Please email the gory details to `[fpderuiter@gmail.com]`. **Seriously, no public GitHub issues.** We're trying to keep the panic contained.
* Tell us what's busted, how *we* can break it ourselves (steps to reproduce are gold), and how bad you think the damage could be.
* Screenshots or code snippets? Nice touch, if you're feeling fancy.

**What Happens Next (Probably):**

* We'll *try* to email you back within 48 hours just to say "Got it!". Don't panic if it takes a bit longer, weddings are distracting.
* Then we'll poke at it, see if it's a real problem or just, you know, a "feature". We'll figure out how much caffeine is required to fix it.
* You should hear back within about 7 business days with an update like "Yep, that's bad," "Nah, that's just Tuesday," or "Fix incoming!".
* If we actually fix it, we'll coordinate with you before bragging... I mean, *disclosing* it publicly, if that's even necessary.

Thanks for helping keep this digital monument to matrimony slightly less vulnerable! We owe you one (maybe a slice of virtual cake?).
