**Hardcoded Value/Setting**
Identify the specific hardcoded value or setting and where it is located (file and line number if possible).

**Reason for Configuration**
Explain why this value should be configurable (e.g., environment-specific, likely to change, sensitive information).

**Suggested Method**
Propose how this should be configured (e.g., Environment variable, `config.js` file, database setting).

**Additional context (Optional)**
Add any other context about the configuration request here.
